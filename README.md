Practical-Machine-Learning---Final-Assignmment

In this project, the goal is to use data gathered from 6 participant in the HAR study. They wear electronic deviceses fitted with accelerometers. The devices are located on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell. Participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
